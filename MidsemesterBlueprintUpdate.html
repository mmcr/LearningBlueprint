<div id="intro-block">
<p>At the beginning of the semester, you completed an assignment in which you identified two goals for your time in our class, unrelated to grades, that met the SMART criteria. In explaining the assignment, I also said:</p>
<blockquote style="font-style: italic; text-align: justify;">In a college or university course, it's easy to become so fixated on your final grade that it overshadows what's truly important: the learning that takes place. To help shift your focus away from worrying about grades, we're going to do two things. First, we'll use a grading system that deemphasizes earning and losing points and which instead looks at how well you've mastered the knowledge and skills that this course covers; more on our grading system can be found in the "Syllabus and More" area. Second, I'd like you to spend some time thinking about your goals for the semester.</blockquote>
<p>Roughly halfway through the semester, this is a good time to revisit those goals and assess your progress. This assignment will be scored using the <b><s class="macro e">#</s><s class="macro m">#</s><s class="macro r">#</s><s class="macro n">#</s></b> scale. To receive a passing score score on this assignment, please meet the following specifications:</p>
<ul>
<li>Write a 1 to 2 page paper with standard 12pt font, double-spaced text, and 1 inch margins.</li>
<li>In your paper, briefly restate each of your two goals and discuss the following:
<ul>
<li>Are you making progress towards meeting your goal? There's no reason to put a specific number (e.g. 75%) on your progress but please describe whether this is a goal that you're close to meeting or one that remains far off.</li>
<li>What leads you to that answerâ€”what is the basis on which you're making your evaluation? What leads you to believe your goals are almost met? Why do you think you've got a long way to go?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Revisit your original Threat Analysis, Learning Schedule, and Learning Strategy.
<ul>
<li>Are things going as you expected this semester? Is learning proving hard than expected? Easier? Are there not challenges slowing you down that you didn't anticipate?</li>
<li>Are there any changes you should make to to when and how you're studying and working on this class? Any old study habits you should change or new ones you've adopted?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Write your responses in a word processing program and save it as either:
<ul style="margin-left: 3rem;">
<li>a Microsoft Word file</li>
<li>a rich text file (RTF)</li>
<li>an Acrobat PDF file</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
