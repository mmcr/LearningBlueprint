<p>Let me cut to the chase: I want you to do well this semester. Research about online education shows there are a lot of things that can get in the way of your success. The research also shows, though, that one of the easiest ways to avoid failure is to plan ahead and stay focused. So to start us off on the right foot, your first assignment for the semester is to develop a plan—a blueprint—for your educational experience this semester.</p>
<p>Your Learning Blueprint will take the form of a 4 page paper (minimum) that must include the following content:</p>
<dl style="margin-left: 2rem; margin-bottom: 2rem; border-left: 1px solid #bbb; padding-left: 1rem;"><dt style="font-weight: bold;">Threat Analysis</dt><dd>What stands in the way of your learning this semester? Are you taking more than a full load of courses? Are you working more than part-time? Do you have aging or ill relatives you need to care for? Are you your children's primary caregiver? If you're an education student, are you student teaching this semester? Try to identify all the forces that could draw your attention and your focus from your learning. Please don't share any more detail than you're comfortable with, but do give an accurate assessment of your situation.</dd><dt style="font-weight: bold; margin-top: 1rem;">Technology Plan</dt><dd>This is an online class. You will not be able to succeed if you don't have access to certain technology basics. Please provide a thorough description of the technological resources available to you and how you will use them for our course. What technology do you own personally? Do you have a desktop? A laptop? A tablet or e-reader? A smartphone? Which of these will you use most regularly to visit Blackboard and conduct other online work?</dd><dd style="text-indent: 1.5rem; margin-top: 0.25rem;">If you don't own the technology you need, what could you borrow or get access to? Where are they located? Are they available all the time or only at limited times (e.g. a public library)?</dd><dd style="text-indent: 1.5rem; margin-top: 0.25rem;">Also, how fast is your most common method of accessing the internet? Do you live on campus? Do you have cable internet service? Are you using a dial-up connection?</dd><dt style="font-weight: bold; margin-top: 1rem;">Technology Backup Plan</dt><dd>Technology, like most things in life, can break. If your main technology breaks, it's going to disrupt your experience in our class. What fall-back options do you have access to? Is there a computer you can borrow? Is there a computer lab or library nearby that you can go to? If your main internet connection is slow or unreliable, how else can you get online (e.g. nearby coffee shops)?</dd><dt style="font-weight: bold; margin-top: 1rem;">Learning Schedule</dt><dd>One of the most common mistakes that students make in an online class is to treat their coursework as something they'll "get around to," usually at the last possible moment. While online learning does offer a lot of flexibility, it stills requires plenty of time and effort. One of the best things you can do is to treat an online class like a face-to-face class and block out time on your calendar to focus on your work.</dd><dd style="text-indent: 1.5rem; margin-top: 0.25rem;">Please look through your schedule for the semester and identify specific blocks of time that you can reserve for our class. Remember that 1) any kind of course should occupy (on average) between 5 and 8 hours of time during your week, and 2) most students report needing more time for an online class. If your schedule permits, it would be best to split your total time into multiple blocks over the week. If possible, try to allow for a little time each day so that you can check-in on course discussions throughout the week.</dd><dd style="text-indent: 1.5rem; margin-top: 0.25rem;">In addition to times, please be explicit about <b>where</b> you will be working on our course. Do you study best in your bedroom? In the library? At a coffee shop? Will you spend your course time alone or with a study partner or a group of other students? Do you need a quiet study environment? Do you tend to study with music, or maybe with a hot cup of coffee? Research about memory formation has shown that the details of WHERE and HOW you learn something become encoded as part of the memory itself.</dd><dt style="font-weight: bold; margin-top: 1rem;">Learning Strategy</dt><dd>Learning is not a passive activity; I can't just pour knowledge into your head. The more active and engaged you are in the learning process, the more you will retain. The learning experiences in our course will include videos, readings, discussions, and simulations. All are designed to communicate course content and to provide opportunities for you to develop your knowledge and skills.</dd><dd style="text-indent: 1.5rem; margin-top: 0.25rem;">How do you plan to retain what you learn in our course? What is your note-taking strategy? Will you take notes by hand in a notebook? Will you type out notes on your computer or tablet? What app or tool will you use (e.g. Wordpad, TextEdit, Evernote, OneNote, Word, etc)? What is your plan for reviewing and reorganizing your notes?</dd><dt style="font-weight: bold; margin-top: 1rem;">Learning Goals</dt><dd>In a college or university course, it's easy to become so fixated on your final grade that it overshadows what's truly important: the learning that takes place. To help shift your focus away from worrying about grades, we're going to do two things. First, we'll use a grading system that deemphasizes earning and losing points and which instead looks at how well you've mastered the knowledge and skills that this course covers; more on our grading system can be found in the "Syllabus and More" area.</dd><dd style="text-indent: 1.5rem; margin-top: 0.25rem;">Second, I'd like you to spend some time thinking about your goals for the semester. Please read <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SMART_criteria" target="_blank">this Wikpedia entry about the SMART Goal method</a>. The five principles of this system are designed to help you set goals that you will both want and be able to achieve, compared to the unrealistic goals that we so often set for ourselves. After reading the article, identify two goals that you'd like to set for your time in this course, but which are <strong>UNRELATED</strong> to grades. These goals should meet the SMART criteria. Describe each goal, why you chose it, and how you plan to reach it.</dd><dt style="font-weight: bold; margin-top: 1rem;">Grade Goal</dt><dd>Identify the final letter grade that you want to achieve in this course. The requirements for each letter grade are clearly stated in the "Syllabus and More" area of the site. You may be tempted to instinctively aim for an "A", but remember that this course is just one component of your overall personal/professional/academic life. If it's simply unrealistic for you to meet all the "A" level requirements given your other life commitments, health, and sanity, there's nothing wrong with working towards a different grade. Whatever target grade you select, please do so thoughtfully and include an explanation of why you chose the grade you did <span style="text-decoration: underline;">and</span> why you believe it's a realistic goal.</dd><dt style="font-weight: bold; margin-top: 1rem;">Educational Reflection</dt><dd>
<div>There are clear differences between online courses and face-to-face courses. Before we embark on this semester, this is a great point to think about what education is and how it works. A few of the questions I'd like you to reflect on:</div>
<ul style="margin-top: 0.25rem;">
<li>How are the roles of "professor" and "student" related? What is each one responsible for? Please avoid non-explanatory answers like "the teacher has to teach." Elaborate. What do you believe "teaching" actually means?</li>
<li>Is it possible for someone to learn things on their own, or does learning happen <i>only</i> in class?</li>
</ul>
<div>To learn more about your own educational experiences, I'd also like to know the following:</div>
<ul style="margin-top: 0.25rem;">
<li>What was your favorite or best class you've ever taken? What about the class or the experience qualifies it as your "best"? Conversely, tell me about your least favorite (or "worst") class?</li>
<li>What about your favorite teacher/professor? What about their personality, behavior, or how they taught made them your favorite? What about your "least favorite" professor?</li>
</ul>
</dd></dl>
<p>Write your Learning Blueprint in a word processing program and save it as either:</p>
<ul>
<li>a Microsoft Word file</li>
<li>a rich text file</li>
<li>an Acrobat PDF file</li>
</ul>
<p>Click the header/title of this item and submit your file using the "Browse My Computer" button in the "ASSIGNMENT SUBMISSION" area.
